# cliflux

`cliflux` is a terminal-ui client for the [Miniflux](https://miniflux.app/) self-hosted RSS reader.

There are many good TUI/CLI RSS reader apps, but when I went looking, I couldn't find one that used Miniflux as its 
source for feeds, read/unread tracking, and "saved" feed entries.

So I built one! And that's what this is.

## Screenshots

## Installation

This package is built in Rust, so if you have that installed, you should be able to just run `cargo install cliflux` to install it.

Otherwise, grab a build for your OS from [the Releases page](https://github.com/spencerwi/cliflux/releases).

## Initial setup

You'll need to supply `cliflux` with two key pieces of configuration, in a TOML file called `config.toml` in
your OS's standard application-configuration-files directory, which would be....

|           Linux            |                               MacOS                        |                  Windows                   | 
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `$XDG_CONFIG_DIR/cliflux/` | `$HOME/Library/Application Support/com.spencerwi.cliflux/` | `%APPDATA%\Roaming\spencerwi\cliflux\` |

(If you're on another OS and you have suggestions on where to put the config file, please open a PR or a Github issue!)

That TOML file should look like this:

```toml
server_url = "your-miniflux-server-url-here-including-port"
api_key = "your-miniflux-api-key-here"
allow_invalid_certs = false
```

You can stub out a default config file by running `cliflux --init`, which will also tell you where the config file 
should live.

To generate an API key for your Miniflux account, log into your Miniflux account on your server and go to 
"Settings" > "API Keys" > "Create a new API key"

## Usage

Once you've got your config file in place, just run `cliflux` and you'll see a list of feed entries fetched 
from your Miniflux server. Up/down arrows (or `k`/`j` for vim delinquents like me) navigate this list, `m` toggles 
the read/unread state of the article, `r` refreshes the list view, and "enter" opens an article for reading, at which 
point it'll be marked as read. 

While reading an article, `u` will mark it as unread, up/down arrows (or, again, `k`/`j`) will scroll up/down, "PageUp"
and "PageDown" will scroll faster, `o` will open the article in your browser, and `b` will go back to the main list view.

If all that seems like a lot to remember, you can hit `?` at any time and get a keyboard reference screen like this:
